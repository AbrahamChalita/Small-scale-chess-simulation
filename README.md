# Small-scale-chess-simulation
The project consists of programming a valid chess board with a white king, a white queen, and the black king. The program runs the black king's turn, and it will return all of the possible moves that are available to the Black King, according to the specific movements of the white queen and king. The program will check if there is a check, and if there are no possible moves determine of there is a checkmate. The objetive is to teach young people the fundamental movements of these pieces using python.
